RNCryptor PHP Tests
-------------------

Unit tests use PHPUnit.  For convenience, a script is included to install a
local copy of it from PEAR.  To install the local copy, run this:

# ./install-local-phpunit.sh

The file in this folder named "phpunit" is a symlink to the local
installation's PHPUnit executable.  To run the tests, do this:

# ./phpunit
