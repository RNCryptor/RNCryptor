RNCryptor PHP Tests
-------------------

To run the tests, do this first:

# ./install-local-phpunit.sh

This will download and install PHPUnit locally in case your OS doesn't have it
installed.  The file in this folder named "phpunit" is a symlink to the local
installation's PHPUnit executable.

When the above script is done, run the tests using this:

# ./phpunit
