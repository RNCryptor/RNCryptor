RNCryptor PHP
-------------

This implementation is fully compatible with Rob Napier's iOS implementation of
RNCryptor.  It supports both encryption and decryption of all RNCryptor schema
versions through version 2.  Due to security concerns with schemas 0 and 1, 
it is strongly recommended to use schema 2 wherever possible.  This is the
default if none is specified.

Basic usage is seen in the examples folder.
