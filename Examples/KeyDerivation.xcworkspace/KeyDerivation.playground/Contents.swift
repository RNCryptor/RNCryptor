 # Generating a key from a password

 Keys are random byte sequences of a specific length. Passwords are not keys. They're not random at all,
 and they can be a wide variety of lengths.

 Converting a password to a key is done by a Key Derivation Function (KDF). The output of a
 correctly-used KDF is indistinguishable from random bytes. The RNCryptor v3 KDF combines a "salt"
 (explained below) and a password to generate a key. This is an expensive operation (tens of
 milliseconds). That's on purpose. Passwords are easily guessed. The goal of a KDF is to make guessing
 them very expensive.

 Since the KDF is expensive, if you have many messages to encrypt or decrypt, it may not be
 practical to re-generate the keys for every message. Instead, you can generate the keys one time
 and use them for many messages. Doing that correctly is the point of this playground.

 The KDF works by combining the salt and the password, and then hashing the result many times in a
 special way that is hard to do in parallel. Each salt+password combination will result in a unique key.
 Without a salt, an attacker could simply apply the KDF to many common passwords, and then quickly
 test those keys against messsages. To avoid this, either the password must be highly random or the
 salt must be highly random.

 This gives us three major scenarios:

 * Human generated passwords
 * Random keys
 * Random passwords

 ## Human generated passwords

 Human generated passwords are terrible, but they're probably why you're reading this playground.
 The only way to save them from themselves is to add a unique random salt. You keep store these
 salts along with the message so you can reconstruct the key later. RNCryptor does this automatically
 when you use passwords, but if you bypass that, you must store the salts yourself somewhere else.
 Usually you would put an envelope around the RNCryptor output that included the salts.

 ## Random keys

 Random keys are the best keys. Besides being the most secure, they're also very fast because you
 don't need a KDF.

 Random keys are not strings. They're two `NSData` objects, 32-bytes long each. If you need to store
 them in a string for some reason, then you need to encode them somehow (hex or Base64 are popular).
 **A 32-character string is not a proper key! If you can type it, it has a tiny fraction of the
 entropy of random bytes of the same length.**

 ## Random passwords

 Random passwords are random character strings rather than random bytes. They're usually a little silly.
 If you're already creating a random password, why not just create a random key? It's much
 more secure without requiring a KDF. But occassionally it can be useful to have something a little
 shorter than a full key if you will ever have to type it (two keys are 128 hex-encoded digits).

 The good news of a random password is that the salt can be static. The point of the salt is to inject
 randomness. If the password is already random, that's not required. I prefer to choose different
 encryption and HMAC salts. There's no attack known against reusing the same key for both, but typically
 it's best not to reuse keys.

    // At this point, you could just use this random password with RNCryptor's password-based API.
    // But if you're trying to only run the KDF one time, here's how to generate the keys with static
    // salts.
