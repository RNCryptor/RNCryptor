/** Encryptor/Decryptor for iOS

  Provides an easy-to-use, Objective-C interface to the AES functionality of CommonCrypto. Simplifies correct handling of
  password stretching (PBKDF2), salting, and IV. For more information on these terms, see "Properly encrypting with AES
  with CommonCrypto," and iOS 5 Programming Pushing the Limits, Chapter 11. Also includes automatic HMAC handling to integrity-check messages.

  RNCryptor is immutable, stateless and thread-safe. A given cryptor object may be used simultaneously on multiple threads,
  and can be reused to encrypt or decrypt an arbitrary number of independent messages.
